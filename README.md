# AVL Tree Practice Tool

A terminal-based interactive learning tool to practice AVL tree insertions, deletions, and rotations. This CLI (Command Line Interface) allows you to explore self-balancing binary search trees with visual feedback and two learning modes: `automatic` and `practice`.

## Features

- ðŸ“ˆ **AVL Tree Visualization**: Displays the tree in a clear grid layout.
- ðŸ¤– **Automatic Mode**: Automatically balances the tree after insertions/deletions.
- ðŸ§  **Practice Mode**: Learn AVL balancing by manually applying the correct rotations.
- ðŸ”„ **Undo/Redo Support**: Revert and replay actions easily.
- ðŸ“š **Step-by-Step Guidance**: See every rotation explained and shown.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Color-Coded Display**:
  - `bright_green` for recently added nodes
  - `red` for unbalanced nodes

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/avl-tree-practice.git
cd avl-tree-practice
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.13 installed.

## Usage

```bash
python -m avltrecli.cli
```

| `reset`                   | Clear the tree and command history         |
| `undo`                    | Undo last action                           |
| `redo`                    | Redo previously undone action              |
| `status`                  | Show current configuration and tree stats  |
| `hint`                    | Show hints for how to balance the tree     |
| `clear`                   | Clear screen and show current state        |
| `help`                    | Display help information                   |
| `exit`                    | Exit the program                           |

## Configuration

You can change runtime settings with:

```bash
config <setting> <value>
```

Available settings:

| Setting         | Values                | Description                                  |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `autoshow`     | `on` / `off`           | Automatically display tree after actions     |
| `steps`        | `on` / `off`           | Show step-by-step balancing actions          |
| `mode`         | `automatic` / `practice` | Switch between learning and auto-balance     |

## Modes

- ðŸŸ¢ **Automatic Mode** (default):  
  The AVL tree balances itself automatically after every operation. Rotate commands are disabled.

- ðŸŸ¡ **Practice Mode**:  
  Balance the tree manually with guided hints and validation. Only correct rotations are allowed.

## Example Session

```bash
> add 30
Added 30 to the tree
> add 20
Added 20 to the tree
> add 10
Tree is unbalanced! Node 30 has balance factor 2
Step 1: Balancing node 30 (balance: 2)
â†’ Performing right rotation on node 30
Tree is now balanced!
```
